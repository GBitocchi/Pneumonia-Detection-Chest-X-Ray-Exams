# Requirements
Training and testing datasets.

## Runtime environment
Pytorch framework was used for the creation and training of neural networks in the following sw environment:
  * Python 3.10.4 version
  * Pytorch 1.11.0 version
  * CUDA 11.6.2 version
  * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 

## Directories

### The 'Arquitectura-CNN-Autogenerada-CGP' contains the 3 following files:

  * Generacion_Arquitectura_CNN_CGP_AWS_SageMaker.ipynb : Notebook that makes use of the CGP technique in order to automatically creates a CNN architecture.
  * Entrenamiento_Arquitectura_Generada_CNN_CGP_AWS_SageMaker.ipynb : Notebook that trains the autogenerated CNN architecture.
  * Evaluacion_Arquitectura_CNN_CGP.ipynb : Notebook that tests the autogenerated CNN architecture.
  
### The 'Benchmark-ResNet50' contains the following file:

  * Benchmark_ResNet50_AWS_SageMaker.ipynb: Notebook that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) over the training and testing datasets and creates a ResNet50 benchmark model.
  
### The 'Grad-CAM' contains the following file:

  * Grad_CAM_Modelo_ResNet50.ipynb: Notebook that uses a test image as an input and returns a heapmap.
